# Build System

Shared build infrastructure for Orkan. Per-module build details are in their respective Technical Specs.

## Dependencies

| Dependency | When needed | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| C17 / C++17 compiler | Always | `CMAKE_C_STANDARD 17` / `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17` |
| CMake >= 3.27 | Always | `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.27)` |
| OpenMP | Library (optional, `ENABLE_OPENMP=ON`) | Homebrew `libomp` on macOS; system package on Linux |
| BLAS/LAPACK ILP64 | Tests and benchmarks only | Accelerate (macOS) or FetchContent OpenBLAS (Linux) |
| Unity v2.6.1 | Tests only | FetchContent (git, `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`) |
| QuEST, Qulacs, Aer | Benchmark (optional) | Auto-detected from `extern/` or system paths |

BLAS is **not** a dependency of the library itself. It is only linked by test and benchmark targets. `Dependencies.cmake` is conditionally included when `BUILD_TESTS` or `BUILD_BENCHMARKS` is ON.

---

## Build Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BUILD_TESTS` | `ON` | Build CTest test suite |
| `BUILD_BENCHMARKS` | `OFF` | Build benchmark targets |
| `ENABLE_OPENMP` | `ON` | Enable OpenMP parallelization |
| `ENABLE_ASAN` | `OFF` | Enable AddressSanitizer + UBSan |
| `LOG_TILE_DIM` | `3` (Debug) / `5` (Release) | Log2 of tile dimension — do not override manually |

---

## Presets (CMakePresets.json)

| Preset | Build type | Binary dir | Tile dim |
|---|---|---|---|
| `debug` | Debug | `cmake-build-debug` | 8x8 |
| `release` | Release | `cmake-build-release` | 32x32 |

A directory/type mismatch (e.g. `cmake-build-debug` with Release) is a `FATAL_ERROR`.

---

## Targets

All target names are derived from the project name (`PROJECT_NAME_LOWER`).

| Target | Type | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `${PROJECT_NAME_LOWER}` | Shared library | `liborkan.dylib` / `liborkan.so` | State, gate, channel, circuit modules |
| `test_state` | Executable | `test/test_state` | State module tests |
| `test_gate` | Executable | `test/test_gate` | Gate module tests |
| `test_circuit` | Executable | `test/test_circuit` | Circuit module tests |
| `test_channel` | Executable | `test/test_channel` | Channel module tests |
| `bench_gate` | Executable | `benchmark/bench_gate` | Gate throughput benchmark (Release only) |
| `bench_kraus` | Executable | `benchmark/bench_kraus` | Kraus channel benchmark (Release only) |
| `profile_*` | Executables | `profile/` | Micro-profiling harnesses |
| `verified_install` | Custom | — | Runs tests, then installs |

---

## Compiler Flags (cmake/CompilerFlags.cmake)

### Orkan_compiler_flags (interface library, linked PRIVATE)

Build-time flags not propagated to consumers:

| Flag | Condition |
|---|---|
| `-fno-strict-aliasing` | Always |
| `-O0` | Debug only |
| `-march=native` | Release only |
| `-lm` | Linux only |

### blas_compiler_flags (interface library)

Forwards BLAS compile definitions, include directories, and link libraries from `Dependencies.cmake`. Linked by test and benchmark targets only.

### OpenMP

`CompilerFlags.cmake` finds OpenMP (with Homebrew hints on macOS) via `find_package(OpenMP)`. The library target links `OpenMP::OpenMP_C` directly (PUBLIC), so consumers inherit the OpenMP dependency transitively.

---

## Install and Package Config

```bash
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
cmake --install cmake-build-release --prefix /usr/local
```

Installs:
- `lib/liborkan.{so,dylib}` with versioning (SOVERSION from `PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR`)
- `include/orkan/` containing: `qlib.h`, `q_types.h`, `state.h`, `gate.h`, `channel.h`, `meas.h`, `circ.h`
- `lib/cmake/orkan/` containing: `OrkanConfig.cmake`, `OrkanConfigVersion.cmake`, `OrkanTargets.cmake`

### Using the installed library

```cmake
find_package(Orkan 0.1 REQUIRED)
add_executable(myapp main.c)
target_link_libraries(myapp Orkan::orkan)
```

```c
#include <orkan/qlib.h>
```

The package config file handles transitive dependencies: when `ENABLE_OPENMP` was ON at build time, `find_package(Orkan)` automatically calls `find_dependency(OpenMP)` (with Homebrew hints on macOS).

Version compatibility uses `SameMajorVersion` — version 1.2 satisfies a request for 1.0, but 2.0 does not.

### Verified install

The `verified_install` target runs all tests before installing:
```bash
cmake --build cmake-build-debug --target verified_install
```

## Platform Notes

| Platform | BLAS (tests only) | OpenMP | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | Apple Accelerate (ILP64 native) | Homebrew `libomp` required | `CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH=1` |
| Linux | FetchContent OpenBLAS with ILP64 | System package | `CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON` |
